#mother function: p=k*p*(1-p) 0<p<1
```{r}
func = function(k,p,n){
  vec = c()
    for(i in 1:n){
      print(p)
      vec=c(vec,p)
      p=k*p*(1-p)
    }
  
  xx = vec[-length(vec)]
  yy = vec[-1]
  
  plot(x = xx, y = yy, xlab = expression("p"[n]) ,ylab = expression("p"[n+1]))
  
}

```

1. when 0<=k<=1, p approaches 0 irrespective initial p value
```{r}
func(0.8,0.5,15)
```

2. when 1<k<=3, p approaches k-1/k
```{r}
func(1.5,0.5,15) # nearer to 1/3
print("------------")
func(2.5,0.71,15) # nearer to 0.6
print("------------")
func(2.8,0.46,25) # nearer to 0.643
```

2. when k>3, the fixed point is repulsive
  and when k<= 3.44 also satisfied, there is a cycle of period 2
```{r}
func(3.1,0.71,16) # further to 0.677
print("------------")
func(3.5,0.56,16) # further to 0.677
```
